# bowling

This bowling API miniproject was an assignment, that I had to do, when applying to Tieto. It was written in January 2013, when I had been a Java developer for 1 year. 

The assignment was to develop a little java library for calculating points during a bowling game and display the current game state. The requirements for the API are located at http://bowling.about.com/od/rulesofthegame/a/bowlingscoring.htm

The API  has to enable to user to 

1. add player's points.
2. ask the current score for a particular player.
3. ask the entire scoreboard.

The API should support the general bowling rules and game logic.
